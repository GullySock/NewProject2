Cats are domesticated predators that went from dangerous hunters to wimpy and fat pets (by wimpy and fat I mean cool and suave). They are independent jerks that depend on us for their food (and we depend on them to defend us).



## Cat Behavior

Cats have some weird behaviors left over from them being actually good at hunting:

1. Cats give humans their dead mice because they see us as part of their group and want to share their kills.

2. Cats like squeezing into boxes and tight spaces because it makes them feel more secure. In the wild they would hide  when trying to rest.

3. Cats will chew non food items to deal with stress or sickness.

4. Cats are carnivores but will eat grass or house plants to get fiber.
